\section{Management Summary}


\label{section:management_summary}
This chapter describes the motivation and the goals of the thesis in more detail.
To provide the reader with the necessary context, the technologies touched by this bachelor thesis are explained at the beginning.
This mainly concerns Dafny and the language server protocol (LSP).

\subsection{Dafny}
\label{section:management_summary:dafny}
Dafny is a compiled language optimized to prove formal correctness \cite{dafnyWiki}.
It bases on \textit{Boogie}, which uses the \textit{Z3} automated theorem prover for discharging proof obligations \cite{dafnyWiki}.
That means, a programmer can define a precondition - a fact that is just given at the start of the code.
The postcondition on the other hand is a statement that must be true after the code has been executed.
Just as the precondition, the postcondition is also defined by the programmer.
In other words, it can be proven, that under a given premise, the code will manipulate data only thus far, so that also the postcondition will be satisfied.
Dafny will formally ensure this.
If it is not guaranteed that the postcondition holds, an error is stated.\\

The following code snippet shows an example.
The value \code{a} is given, but it is required to be positive.
This is the precondition.
In the method body, the variable \code{b} is assigned the negative of \code{a}.
We ensure, that \code{b} must be negative, which is the postcondition.
\begin{lstlisting}[language=dafny, caption={Simple Dafny Example}, captionpos=b, label={lst:simpleDafnyExample}]
method Negate(a: int) returns (b: int)
requires a > 0
ensures b < 0
{
    b := -a;
}
\end{lstlisting}
This example is of course trivial.
In a real project, correctness is not always that obvious.
With Dafny, a programmer can be sure if the program is correct.
Since the proof is done with formal, mathematical methods, the correctness is guaranteed.\\


\subsection{Language Server Protocol}
The language server protocol (LSP) was created to unify communication between an integrated development environment (IDE) and a language server.
It specifies requests, such as AutoCompletion, rename or GoToDefinition.
If the user performs an action like rename, the IDE will send the proper request to the language server.
The message format is specified by the LSP and bases on JSON.

The language server is responsible to calculate a proper result.
For the example of a rename request, the answer contains the information where to apply the renaming.
It is the task of the server to analyze the source code and provide a rename response with respect to language specific rules.\\

Since the language server is independent of the client, a language server can be used from within multiple IDE's.
To provide support for another IDE, just the client has to be coded.
Since all logic is contained within the server, this can be done with minimal effort.
A developer only has to set up the connection to the language server.



\subsection{Initial Situation}
\label{section:managment_summary:initialsolution}
In a previous bachelor thesis by Markus Schaden and Rafael Krucker, a LSP client-server infrastructure for Visual Studio Code was created to support Dafny \cite{ba}.
The plugin was particularly appreciated by the "HSR Correctness Lab" \cite{correctnessLab} to make coding in Dafny easier.
The pre-existing solution offered a LSP-client for Visual Studio Code, which connected to a language server.
Both, the language server and the plugin, were written in TypeScript.
To communicate with the Dafny backend, the language server used a proprietary JSON-interface.
Information provided by Dafny was parsed from the console.
Functionality was therefore limited to the Dafny console output.\\
In the preceding semester project \cite{sa}, the language server was migrated to \CsharpWithSpace and could be integrated into the Dafny backend.
Any Dafny functionality was directly accessible and the proprietary JSON-interface, as well as console parsing, could be omitted.
All features were reimplemented to satisfy the new architectural layout.

\subsection{Goals}
At HSR, Dafny is taught within the course \textit{Software Engineering}.
Students have to make their first steps in Dafny, using a simple tutorial.
The course is taught at the third and fourth semester.
Students are already used to integrated development editors, IDEs.
These commonly provide features like
\begin{itemize}
    \item Error highlighting
    \item Compile and run
    \item AutoCompletion
\end{itemize}

To provide a nice environment to the students while they explore Dafny, they shall also profit by these features in the Software Engineering course.
Therefore, common IDE features shall be provided.

On the other hand, the plugin shall also be used in a professional environment.
Thus, more advanced features have to be supported.
To facilitate the development of further features, the code shall be refactored to achieve a clean state.
This especially involves a clear architectural layout with dependencies that only point downwards.

Aside a clean architecture, a major goal is the creation of a custom symbol table.
This is necessary to make features like \textit{GoToDefinition} or \textit{AutoCompletion} possible at all.
It also allows the development of further features.
For example, if every the symbol table provides information about the scope-depth, the indentation width can be deduced for a feature like auto formatting.\\

The symbol table shall further contain a well organized tree structure, so that navigation can be done efficiently.
Each symbol shall have direct links to it's parent, children and declaration for very fast access.
Compared to the prototype, the pre-existing implementations can be extracted into the symbol table, reducing the lines of code (LOC) and increasing performance.



\subsection{Results}
\label{section:managment_summary:results}
%%intro
Within this bachelor thesis, the development of the pre-existing language server and its VSCode client was continued.
Significant improvements could be achieved.

%%Features
The following features are supported by the server:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Syntax highlighting
    \item Verification, highlighting of errors and warnings
    \item Compilation
    \item Show CounterExample
    \item CodeLens
    \item AutoCompletion
    \item Renaming
    \item Hover Information
\end{itemize}

In comparison to the initial solution, any pre-existing features were improved.

\begin{itemize}
 \item Compilation will no longer start a dedicated Dafny process for compilation. Instead, it will now use a buffered pre-compilat generated by verification and directly call the Dafny's compile method, to generate an executable.
 \item CounterExample representation is now much cleaner and easier to perceive.
 \item Verification will now also show warnings.
 \item Verification will no longer just highlight single characters.
 \item CodeLens can now actively be used to preview symbol usages.
 \item AutoCompletion no longer performs simple pattern matching, but provides exact results.
\end{itemize}
Renaming and hover information could newly be implemented due to the offerings of the symbol table.
The user can now benefit by a plugin, which gained a lot of user experience, but also robustness compared to the initial solution.\\

%%Dev Benefits.
Aside the improvements in features, many internal aspects were also improved.
A component called Dafny translation unit was completely re-visited and simplified.
The component accesses any Dafny functionality.
For example, instead of passing Dafny options as an array of strings, they are now set by
directly accessing Dafny's config class.
Any results provided by the Dafny translation unit are buffered for later re-use at compilation or to create the symbol table.
This makes the implementation significantly more performant.\\

%%ST
The targeted symbol table could be implemented for the most important Dafny language features.
Various challenges had to be accommodated, including the handling of default scopes, default classes, inheritance, external file import or variable hiding.
All of these are properly handled, but in exchange to this quality attribute, not all Dafny language features are supported by the symbol table.
For example, custom datatypes\footnote{for example datatype Tree<T> = Empty | Node(left:Tree,root:T,right:Tree)}, as used in formal programming languages, are not supported.\\

The symbol table opens the option to implement many more features than currently provided.
For example, the LSP offers a highlight request, marking occurrences of a symbol.
Any information required for this feature are already provided by the symbol table.
Thus, adding this feature would be very simple.


%%client
Aside changes in the server, the VSCode client is now as lightweight as possible.
This makes the adaption to other IDE's very simple.
The server is now able to create a symbol table containing any information required for the langue analysis features.
Pre-existing features and algorithms were improved to gain more reliability and a better user experience.


\subsection{Outlook}
While the quality of the features, as well as the general code quality could be massively improved, the functionality of the project could be improved even further.
Ideas include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Automatic generation of contracts
    \item Debugging
    \item Create clients for other IDE's.
\end{itemize}
Aside the widening of the feature range, it is definitely necessary to complete the visitor, which currently only traverses the most important AST node.
This was due to the limited time frame of the bachelor thesis.
Nevertheless, the plugin is of a nice quality and may be deployed into the VSCode market place.
Thus, future students can work with it and make their first steps in the Dafny programming language using our plugin.
