\section{Implementation}

\subsection{Symbol Table}

\subsubsection{Feature Support}
Since we have object information (and not just strings anymore) with our self-written symbol table,
the whole position to string parsing was dropped. \\

In our old version we had to find out from the current cursor position which word in the code could be meant.
Then we iterated over the whole symbol table and checked if there was a symbol with the same string as name.
The first match was looked at as a meant symbol. \\

Our new design eliminates all of this effort and avoidable assumptions.
We access the currently marked symbol directly via the position data.
String comparisons and corresponding string extractions are completely eliminated.
This leads to better performance and above all to reliable symbol references.
